                        <p>
                            Times are changing, so much so that many firearms owners are laying down conventional guns
                            for the
                            modern, air-powered counterpart. Air guns have come a
                            long way over the years and are more fun to shoot, easier to shoot, and more accurate than
                            ever before.
                            If you are yearning for some trigger time or looking
                            to go on a hunt, Umarex® USA has an airgun for you.

                        <h1>THE CO2 OF AIRGUNS: TIPS AND TRICKS</h1>
                        <p>
                            CO2 is a convenient and easy-to-use power source in many air guns to launch a pellet or BB
                            downrange. It
                            comes in different sizes and formats but your most
                            common will be 12 gram and 88 gram cartridges.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            CO2 is readily available and easy to carry. When using CO2, use a drop of silicone oil on
                            the tip of
                            each new capsule to help maintain the integrity of your
                            air gun seals. This will keep the seals and internals lubricated for a longer air gun life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            CO2 is a gas, so the lower the outside temperature when using CO2, the lower the gas
                            pressure, and
                            therefore lower shooting velocities. Temperatures below 65
                            degrees Fahrenheit can also freeze the airgun value. On cold days, keep your CO2 in a warm
                            location. A
                            couple of hot hands and a jacket pocket or small ice
                            chest are a great way to keep your CO2 to temperature and in working order. Just be sure not
                            to put your
                            CO2 on a direct heat source like a wood stove.

                        <h1>HOW TO FILL PCP AIR GUNS</h1>
                        <p>
                            The most economical method to fill your PCP air gun is with the Umarex Hand Pump. These
                            pumps compress a
                            small amount of air to the high pressure needed to
                            fill the PCP gun’s tank. Yes, it does take a while to pump up an air rifle’s tank, but if
                            you are not
                            afraid to sweat, the hand pump could be a good option
                            for you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you are over the hand pumping and the sweat equity involved, the Umarex ReadyAir ™
                            Portable Airgun
                            Compressor will do all the heavy lifting. Just plug the
                            high-pressure compressor into a 110v AV outlet or clamp onto a 12v DC power source like your
                            car
                            battery. The ReadyAir is a maintenance-free design; there is
                            no oil to change and with auto shutoff, you can be sure your investment is protected from
                            overheating.
                            In a matter of minutes, the rifle’s tank will be topped
                            off and ready for action.

                            Umarex Hammer didn’t alter the laws of physics. It just
                            took advantage of them. The Umarex Hammer’s primary objective was to accelerate a greater
                            mass faster
                            using technology, ingenuity, and a big .510 caliber
                            barrel. The Umarex Hammer is not just another air rifle. It’s made for hunting big game. The
                            Hammer has
                            proven itself on many hunts during its long
                            development cycle with a wide variety of big game. Rossi Morreale of American Airgunner took
                            an Oryx on
                            a hunt in Texas and a whitetail deer in Arkansas and
                            professional hunter and TV host Steve Scott has harvested an American Bison and the big
                            African Cape
                            Buffalo. Steve Criner, host of Real Air Gun Hunting has
                            harvested many feral hogs and bobcats, huntress Brittney Glaze harvested an Axis deer, and
